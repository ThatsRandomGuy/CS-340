How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

In order to create programs that are maintainalbe, readable, and adaptable, it is important to use comments to explain what is happening in your code. Doing this allows for future developers to understand what is happening and where they need to make changes. This way the developer does not need to ask you what the code does, they can just read it themselves. This CRUD module can be used for just about any database. The functions can also be used in other programs just like I used them for a graph and interactive table in project two. 

How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

I like to approach problems one step at a time. In the case of both the projects in this course, I completed each FIXME section one at a time. Then I went back and made sure each section worked with one another. This approach was very similar to how I approached other assignments, but this was different due to the compatibility required for the program to work. There was a lot of trial and error in this step which I feel did not come as much from other assignments. I will continue to use the one step at a time strategy with other projects because it allows me to look at the project in small pieces rather than as a whole. I find that looking at the whole project causes me a lot more stress.

What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

I think computer scientists do something very similar because when they work in groups, they are often assigned small pieces of a project that then connect together to make the whole project. I think this project helps Grazioso Salvare because it allows them to view their data in a much easier way. Not everyone knows how to navigate a database and by putting that data in a user-friendly environment, it is directly helping them.
